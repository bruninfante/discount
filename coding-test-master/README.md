# Coding Test

In order to gain insights in your development skills, we created this development exercise.

## What to do?

We have several problems to solve. Our recruiter would have normally told you which one(s) to solve.
You are free to use whatever technologies you want, unless instructed otherwise.

- [Problem 1 : Discounts](./1-discounts.md)
- [Problem 2 : Ordering](./2-ordering.md)

## Procedure

We would like you to send us (a link to) a git repository (that we can access).  
We also need some documentation on how to run your app and how we can verify it will still run after we made some changes to it).  
There is no time limit on this exercise, just take as long as you need to show us your development skills.

## Problems?

Feel free to contact us if something is not clear.
